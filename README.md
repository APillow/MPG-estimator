# MPG-estimator
Data Science 1 Final

This is my first GitHub post, basically a complete trial run of posting/branching/commiting code, so be nice..

The task of this project is as follows:

A market research company has created a data set on different popular cars in the world. You are
approached to deliver the following data analytics products:

1. Data Exploration: Create one (or more if necessary) graph(s) which enables the user to
  pick different variables in the data set and explore their individual or group behavior.
(40 points)
- use Plotly.
- use different control widgets (Dropdown menus, Button, Slider, etc.) and be creative
- extract useful information we might not know otherwise

2. Regression: Develop a regression model to predict cars’ mpg based on other features.
(30 points)
- validate your results.

3. Classification: Create a new variable as a flag for those cars with acceleration above 15 or
  less than/equal to 15. Name the new variable as “Target”. Develop a classifier to classify
  cars based on their different features and the Target as the response variable.
(30 points)
- avoid overfitting.
- create visualizations
- Make sure that you report your conclusion about the model’s performance based on different criteria.
- Feel free to compare different models (with different parameters) to gain acceptable results.
